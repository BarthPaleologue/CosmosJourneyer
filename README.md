## What is Cosmos Journeyer?

Cosmos Journeyer is a space exploration game running directly in the browser! Take your spaceship and witness the beauty of this virtually infinite universe.

From stellar black holes and fully explorable planets down to single grass blades, to asteroid fields, your journey will be unforgettable.

## How to play

### Online

You can play freely from the main website of the project at [cosmosjourneyer.com](https://cosmosjourneyer.com/)

### Locally

You can also play locally! You can get an installer for your system by going to [the latest release](https://github.com/BarthPaleologue/CosmosJourneyer/releases).

If you want the cutting edge version, follow these steps:

1. Install prerequisites:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (install with your package manager or from https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (install with your package manager or from https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (install with `npm install -g pnpm`)

2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/BarthPaleologue/CosmosJourneyer.git`
3. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
4. Build the project with `pnpm build`
5. Serve the project with `pnpm serve:prod`
6. Play at http://localhost:8080

To update your local version, either download the latest installer or run `git pull` in your local install.

### Gameplay

Once Cosmos Journeyer has started, simply start a new game: tutorials will guide you through the basics of the game as you play.

You can pause the game at any time by pressing `ESC` and access the main menu to have a look at the keybindings, view the credits, and save your game.

The game has auto-saves, so you can quit at any time and resume your game later from where you left off.

## Community and support

## My vision for the project

For my detailed vision for the project, please refer to the [VISION.md](./VISION.md) file.

## Why Cosmos Journeyer?

Why make Cosmos Journeyer when games like Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky or Kerbal Space Program already exist?

There are many reasons of course but here are the main ones:

- **Open Source**: Other games such as Elite are dependent on their studios to keep them alive. When the game will no
  longer be profitable, they will stop supporting it and then the games will be dead forever (see Kerbal Space Program 2 debacle for a recent example). By going open-source,
  Cosmos Journeyer will be able to evolve and improve continuously, without the need for a studio. Anyone can pick it up
  and make it their own.
- **Exploration Focused**: I always felt that exploration was the most interesting part of space games. At the same time
  I feel the other games are too focused on combat, trading or multiplayer content. I want Cosmos Journeyer to be an
  exploration first game, where your main drive is to discover cool things, take pictures, and dream for a bit.
- **Personal**: I don't know it's just so exciting to create an entire universe from scratch. It really is a dream
  coming true for me.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! There is too much to do for one person alone.

If you want to contribute, you will find guidelines and ideas [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Sponsor

Help me make Cosmos Journeyer a reality! The development is time-consuming but generates no revenue by itself.

Sponsoring the project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/barthpaleologue)
or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BarthPaleologue) will help secure the future of the project.

The project also has a ko-fi page at https://ko-fi.com/cosmosjourneyer if you feel like buying me a coffee!

## Roadmap

You can have a look at the roadmap of the project on the website at https://cosmosjourneyer.com/

The deadlines are not set in stone and can be moved around as I am not working full time on the project.

## Features

Explore telluric planet and moon surfaces from your spaceship or by foot.

Travel between worlds without any loading screens.

Planet surfaces are filled with procedural vegetation, rocks and butterflies to make them feel more alive.

Cosmos Journeyer generates a virtually infinite amount of star systems that all have a star, planets, and sometimes moons.

## Development

### Tech stack

Cosmos Journeyer is built using the following technologies:

- [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for the 3D engine
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the programming language
- [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) for bundling the application
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for the package manager
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for building the desktop application
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for versioning large files like screenshots

### Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher)
2. Install [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) globally with `npm install -g pnpm`
3. Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) globally with `git lfs install` (this is required to handle large files like screenshots)
4. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/BarthPaleologue/CosmosJourneyer.git`
5. Navigate to the project directory with `cd CosmosJourneyer`
6. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
   (this also sets up Git hooks for formatting changed files before commit.
   For pnpm 10 and later, hooks are installed because Husky is listed in
   `onlyBuiltDependencies`.)

### Building

#### Web

To build the web version of Cosmos Journeyer, run `pnpm build`. Everything will be built in the `dist` folder.

To start the production server version, run `pnpm serve:prod`. The development version can be started with `pnpm serve`.

#### Tauri

Cosmos Journeyer can be built as a desktop application using Tauri.

To find what dependencies your OS is missing, run `pnpm tauri info`.

Then you can build the application with `pnpm tauri build` or run the dev version with `pnpm tauri dev`.

The build artifacts will appear in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/<platform>`.

### Testing

Cosmos Journeyer has unit tests and end-to-end tests.

You can run the unit tests with `pnpm test:unit` and the end-to-end tests with `pnpm test:e2e:docker`.

### Formatting

Cosmos Journeyer uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Changed files are automatically formatted via a pre-commit hook. You can also format the entire project with `pnpm format`.

### Linting

Cosmos Journeyer uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. You can lint the code with `pnpm lint`.

### Documentation

The documentation is online at https://barthpaleologue.github.io/CosmosJourneyer/doc/

Additionally, the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) file contains a big picture explanation of the architecture of
the project.

To build it locally, run `pnpm doc` and then `pnpm serve:doc` to serve it at `localhost:8081`.
