Every telluric planet and moon has a surface that can be explored by the player using a spaceship, or by foot!

Cosmos Journeyer allows to travel from one celestial body to another without any loading screen, giving the player a seamless experience while exploring.

Planet surfaces are filled with procedural vegetation and rocks and butterflies to make them feel more alive.

Cosmos Journeyer generates a virtually infinite amount of star systems that all have a star, often planets, and sometimes moons.
