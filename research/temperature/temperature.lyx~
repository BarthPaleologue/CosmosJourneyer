\begin_layout Title
Mean temperature of a planet using orbital settings and star properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
by Barthélemy Paléologue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
To achieve the goal of creating procedural solar systems with realistic
 properties, it is necessary to compute the temperature of each planet so
 that it can influence its geological generation, enabling the differenciation
 between frozen world from toasted ones from habitables ones.
 The approach I will use here is to use a planet's energy budget to compute
 its average temperature using only the physical properties of its star
 such as its temperature and radius and using the properties of the planet
 : its distance to the star, its albedo, and greenhouse effect.

\begin_layout Section*
Symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the variables that we will be using :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{star}$
\end_inset

 is the temperature of the star in 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{star}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the star in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{planet}$
\end_inset

 is the temperature of the planet in 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{planet}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the planet in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the planet and its star in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the albedo of the planet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the greenhouse effect factor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The star will be assimilated to a perfect black body for the entirety of
 the demonstration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The energy emitted by the star
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total energy emitted by the star can be obtained using Stefan-Boltzmann
 law to compute the energy per unit of surface (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{star}=\sigma T_{star}^{4}$
\end_inset

).
 Then we can multiply by the surface of the sun (
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi R_{star}^{2}$
\end_inset

) :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{star}=\Phi_{star}\times S_{star}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{star}=4\pi\sigma R_{star}^{2}T_{star}^{4}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The energy received by the planet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The planet we are studying will only receive part of this energy.
 As the planet is at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of the star, the energy of the star will be spread across the emission
 sphere centered on the star, whose radius is 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore we have to compute the per surface energy received by the planet
 at the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 We can then find the amount of energy received by the planet by multiplying
 by the surface of the apparent disk of the planet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{received}=\frac{P_{star}}{S_{emission}}S_{planetdisk}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{received}=\frac{4\pi\sigma R_{star}^{2}T_{star}^{4}}{4\pi D^{2}}\pi R_{planet}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{received}=\frac{\pi\sigma R_{star}^{2}R_{planet}^{2}T_{star}^{4}}{D^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Accounting for the albedo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of this energy is reflected into space because of the natural color
 of the planet.
 This phenomenon is called albedo, which represents the percentage of energy
 reflected into space.
 Knowing that we can compute the amount of energy absorbed by the planet
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{absorbed}=(1-A)P_{received}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{absorbed}=(1-A)\frac{\pi\sigma R_{star}^{2}R_{planet}^{2}T_{star}^{4}}{D^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Greenhouse effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The energy absorbed is then reemitted by infrared radiation using the Stefan-Bol
tzmann law we used during part 1.
 We have already taken account of the albedo so we can consider all the
 remaining energy is absorbed, thus we do not need to specify the emissivity
 of the planet in the Stefan-Boltzmann formula :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{reemitted}=P_{absorbed}=\sigma T_{planet}^{4}\times4\pi R_{planet}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of this reemitted energy will be sent back to the planet's surface because
 of the greenhouse effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can then write the complete energy budget of the planet using this model
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{reemited}=P_{absorbed}+P_{greenhouse}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{greenhouse}=\alpha P_{reemited}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{absorbed}+\alpha P_{reemited}=P_{reemited}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1-A}{1-\alpha}P_{received}=P_{reemited}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Calculating the planet's average temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the relation we found, we can extract the temperature of the planet
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1-A}{1-\alpha}\times\frac{\pi\sigma R_{star}^{2}R_{planet}^{2}T_{star}^{4}}{D^{2}}=4\pi\sigma R_{planet}^{2}T_{planet}^{4}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1-A}{1-\alpha}\times\frac{R_{star}^{2}T_{star}^{4}}{D^{2}}=4T_{planet}^{4}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{planet}^{4}=\frac{1-A}{1-\alpha}\times\frac{R_{star}^{2}}{4D^{2}}T_{star}^{4}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{planet}=T_{star}\times\sqrt[4]{\frac{(1-A)R_{star}^{2}}{4(1-\alpha)D^{2}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Testing the formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's test this formula for the earth and the sun.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{star}=5770K$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{star}=696\times10^{6}m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D=150\times10^{9}m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A=0.3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.4$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{planet}=289K=16°C
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close enough ! Moreover this simple model can also show how greenhouse effect
 can have a huge impact on the average temperature of earth : by changing
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.4$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.42$
\end_inset

, we already increase the temperature by more than two degrees on the surface
 of the planet !
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Usability in procedural generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generation of procedural solar systems can be boiled down to the choice
 of the different physical parameters of the planets and the stars.
 As we have large amounts of data on stars like their radius and temperatures,
 generating these parameters in a realistic way is achievable.
 Therefore knowing 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{star}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{star}$
\end_inset

 is not problematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance of the planet to its star is someting that can be chosen using
 a random range during the generation of the system, consequently we know
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulties arise when talking about 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the two parameters are interdependent, making the generation process
 difficult.
 An increase of temperature caused by an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 can for example reduce the amount of ice on a planet, thus reducing its
 albedo 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, thus decreasing the temperature of the planet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to avoid this complication could be choosing first the temperature
 of the planet in a reasonable range and then derivating the albedo and
 the the greenhouse effect, but it would defeat the purpose of the formula
 which was to compute the temperature.
