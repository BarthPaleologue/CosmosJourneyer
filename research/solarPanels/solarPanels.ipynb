With this model, it will be possible to compute the area needed for Cosmos Journeyer's space stations. Multiples factors will be considered, such as the distance between the station and its main star, the station population, the energy consumption per person, the efficiency of the solar panels, and the energy storage capacity. To check the calculations, I will try to calculate the area needed for the international space station (ISS) and compare it with the real data."
