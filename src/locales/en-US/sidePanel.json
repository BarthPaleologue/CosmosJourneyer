    "aboutText": "Hello fellow explorer!\nI am the creator of Cosmos Journeyer, and I am glad you're interested in this project. It was years in the making you see: back in 2016 already, when I was working on my 3D planetarium, I dreamed about making the planets fully explorable. But then I was limited by how little I knew about computer graphics.\n\nI only started Cosmos Journeyer years later as a way to escape from the stress of my studies in French \"classes préparatoires\". At first, it was only a small procedural planet generator, which was called PlanetEngine. But as ideas kept on coming, I continued working on it for years and the project grew way beyond what I had imagined at first.\n\nAs I understand now that such projects cannot be achieved alone, I decided to open-source Cosmos Journeyer so that anyone can freely use and modify it to their liking and even contribute to the project.\n\nI hope you will enjoy CosmosJourneyer as much as I enjoy making it!",
