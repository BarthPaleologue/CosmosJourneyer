    <p class="aboutText">
      Hello fellow explorer!<br />
      I am the creator of CosmosJourneyer, and I am glad you're interested in this project.
      It was years in the making you see: back in 2016 already, when I was working on my 3D planetarium, I dreamed about
      making the planets fully explorable. But then I was limited by how little I knew about computer graphics.<br />
      <br />
      I only started CosmosJourneyer years later as a way to escape from the stress of my studies in French "classes
      préparatoires". At first, it was only a small procedural planet generator, which was called PlanetEngine.
      But as ideas kept on coming, I continued working on it for years and the project grew way beyond what I had
      imagined at first.<br />
      <br />
      As I understand now that such projects cannot be achieved alone, I decided to open-source CosmosJourneyer so that
      anyone could freely use and modify it to their liking and even contribute to the project.<br />
      <br />
      I hope you will enjoy CosmosJourneyer as much as I enjoy making it!
