    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="aboutText">When I started working on CosmosJourneyer, I only wanted to play with procedural planets as a challenge to escape from the reality that was my life then, finishing my studies in French preparatory schools.
      <br/>The more I toyed with it, the more ideas came to me and the project grew way beyond anything I could have imagined at the time as I couldn't stop myself from adding more and more features.
      <br/>What I once called PlanetEngine encompassed much more than planets, and it became CosmosJourneyer: an old dream of mine come true.
      <br/>As I understand now that such a project cannot be achieved alone, I decided it should be open-source so that anyone could freely use and modify it to their liking, contributing to the project.
      <br/>This is why CosmosJourneyer is free now and forever, for everyone.
      <br/>
      <br/>I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoy making it
