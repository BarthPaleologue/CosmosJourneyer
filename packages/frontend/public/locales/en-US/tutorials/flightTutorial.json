    "welcome": "Welcome to Cosmos Journeyer, Commander! If this is your first time, this tutorial will cover the basics of space flight.",
    "spaceShipRotationTitle": "Spaceship Rotation",
    "spaceShipRotationText1": "The spaceship rotation is controlled by the mouse. Moving the mouse left or right will make the spaceship roll. Moving the mouse up or down will make the spaceship pitch.",
    "spaceShipRotationText2": "The yellow arrow on the screen is there to help you understand the orientation of the spaceship. Its opacity also indicates the rate of rotation.",
    "spaceShipRotationText3": "Try to get a feel for the controls by rotating the spaceship. You will get better at it with practice.",
    "spaceShipThrustTitle": "Spaceship Thrust",
    "spaceShipThrustText1": "You can throttle the main engines with {{keyIncrease}} and {{keyDecrease}}. Pressing {{keyKill}} will set the throttle to zero.",
    "spaceShipThrustText2": "Your throttle is displayed as a vertical progress bar on the bottom right of the screen alongside your speed.",
    "spaceShipThrustText3": "Try flying around in the asteroid field to get familiar with the controls.",
    "spaceShipWarpDriveTitle": "Warp Drive",
    "spaceShipWarpDriveText1": "Moving between planets and stars will often require faster than light (FTL) travel in order to reach your destination before the heat death of the universe.",
    "spaceShipWarpDriveText2": "Your spaceship comes equipped with a warp drive to do just that. Pressing {{keyToggle}} will toggle the warp drive on and off. The warp throttle can be adjusted like for the main engines.",
    "spaceShipWarpDriveText3": "Fly up or down to leave the asteroid field and then engage your warp drive to fly away to the stars!",
    "spaceShipTargetingTitle": "Targeting",
    "spaceShipTargetingText1": "Getting lost in space is fairly easy! Thankfully your spaceship comes equipped with a targeting system to help with that.",
    "spaceShipTargetingText2": "Pressing {{keyTarget}} will target the object closest to the center of the screen. This will display the info until you get close enough (it will then fade out). Space stations have a squarish target icon.",
    "spaceShipTargetingText3": "The radar (on the bottom right of the screen) can help you with orientation when you are not facing your target. An empty circle means the target is behind your ship, while a full dot means the target is in front of your ship.",
    "congratulationsText1": "Congratulations, Commander! You have completed the flight tutorial. You are now ready to explore the cosmos. Good luck, and have fun!"
